# GyroType App

GyroType is an innovative mobile app designed to help individuals with motor impairments by utilizing the phone's gyroscope for text input. Whether you're navigating a virtual keyboard or composing messages, GyroType aims to make typing more accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Gyroscope-based Typing:** Instead of traditional touch typing, users can tilt their phone to select letters, words, and symbols.
- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Adjust the gyroscope sensitivity to match individual comfort levels.
- **Word Prediction:** Smart word prediction algorithms suggest relevant words based on context.
- **Minimalist Interface:** A clean and straightforward UI ensures ease of use.

## Prototype Details

A new approach to typing, trying to help people with some motor problems, such as Parkinson's disease or tendonitis.

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Gyroscope Interaction:
- **Current State:**
  - Basic prototype with arrow key input (as placeholders for gyroscope functionality).
  - Limited functionality for demonstration purposes.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Implement gyroscope-based typing.
  - Integrate word prediction algorithms.
  - Improve UI/UX design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/BernardoLannes/word-in-hand.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use arrow keys to simulate gyroscope input (for now).
